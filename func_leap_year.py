# We add a Leap Day on February 29, almost every four years. The leap day is an extra, or intercalary day and we add it to the shortest month of the year, February.
# In the Gregorian calendar three criteria must be taken into account to identify leap years:

# The year can be evenly divided by 4, is a leap year, unless:
# The year can be evenly divided by 100, it is NOT a leap year, unless:
# The year is also evenly divisible by 400. Then it is a leap year.
# This means that in the Gregorian calendar, the years 2000 and 2400 are leap years, while 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200, 2300 and 2500 are NOT leap years.Source

# Task
# You are given the year, and you have to write a function to check if the year is leap or not.

# Note that you have to complete the function and remaining code is given as template.
